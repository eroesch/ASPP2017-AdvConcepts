# ASPP2017 - Iterators, Generators, Decorators & Context Managers (and other fun stuff to handle data and resources properly)

This notebook/presentation has been prepared for the 2017 edition of [http://python.g-node.org][1], the renowned Advanced Scientific Programming in Python summer school (Happy 10th Anniversary!!). I gratefully acknowledge the efforts of the entire Python community, which produced great documentation I largely consumed to create this notebook; a list of which can be found at the end of the notebook. If I have missed anyone, apologies, let me know and I'll add you to the list!

Although you should be able to run the notebook straight out of the box, bear in mind that it was designed to work in conjunction with the following nbextensions:
* RISE by [https://github.com/damianavila/RISE][5] (enables the slideshow)
* Runtools by [https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/wiki/Runtools][6] (runs the entire notebook regardless of exceptions thrown on the way, as we will be covering recovering from errors)

The repository also contains exercises, with and without solutions, which I borrowed from last year's edition of the summer school.

I hope you enjoy it! By all means get in touch! :)
